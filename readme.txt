*Please note you will need the following plugins installed to completely automate the process of collection of contracts using WP Forms and WP E-Signature.*
1. [WP Forms](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)
2. [WP E-Signature](http://aprv.me/2lIyMBx) (Ultimate, Business or Pro license)
3. [Stand Alone Document](http://aprv.me/2ko4HGU) (comes with above licenses)

*An Ultimate, Business or Pro license license is required and can be purchased at [www.approveme.com](https://www.approveme.com/email-limited-pricing/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpforms)


**What would you do if you discover the contracts you used in running your online business were not legally binding?**


Imagine being in a courtroom with an estranged client who’s claiming that they never agreed to your contract.  You pull up the contract and after a brief review, the judge announces that the e-signature used in the contract was not legally valid.  He then asks if you have anything else to support your case.

Hopefully it will never come to to this, but if it did, what would you do?

Well, there’s not much you could do.

The electronic document industry has very strict rules and regulations for legal contracts, invoices, employee agreements and any other legally binding document you may use in your business.  

Digital security is crucial to your business.  You need to protect yourself from anything that could call your forms into question.

**The ApproveMe WP ESignature Plugin turns your WordPress site into a court recognized document signing application.**

If you’re a WP Forms user, you know how powerful their plugin can be to help automate a number of tasks on your website.  HOWEVER, signing legally binding contracts is NOT their primary focus.  That’s where we come in.

The WP Forms Digital Signature Add-On ensures that every form, contract, or invoice submitted with the WP Form plugin is 100% UETA/ESIGN compliant.

No more second-guessing the legality of your forms or needing to use a third-party signing service.

We’ve invested years into building a system that adheres the strictest nationwide and foreign document signing regulations while allowing you to control your user experience.  

You get a 100% legally compliant signature on file to protect you and the customer, without having to worry about users getting distracted or being unsecure on third party sites.


**[Click Here to Try WP Forms Signature Demo](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpforms)**

**Most Contract & E-Signature Plugins** simply record signature details and submit the data to a web server where it is converted to a PNG or JPEG file.  This graphic file then gets saved on your FTP server.

This image file of your client’s hand-written legal signature — the same one used to buy houses, sign up for credit cards, and obtain business loans — is easily accessible to any FTP intruders.

Here’s the problem:  

Most of these plugins are not legally binding (much less UETA/ESIGN compliant) as they fail to address the countless laws and regulations that guide the document signing industry.

If the legality of your contract were to ever come into question, you wouldn’t have much to stand alone.  And if fraud or identity theft were ever an issue, you would have a tough time proving your case with a signature that the courts don’t recognize.  Why risk it?

**The Powerful Features of ApproveMe’s Digital Signature Add-On for WP Forms:**

*UETA/ESIGN Compliance*

Our plugin is 100% compliant and kept up to date with the most current rules and regulations regarding electronic signatures and legally binding contracts.  Rest easy knowing that your documents will stand up in any court.*

*Encrypted Data Storage*

Rather than storing data on a vulnerable FTP server like other plugins, we encrypt and store your data in strategic (and different) locations in your database.  Signatures, custom input fields, document data, audit trail events — everything is secured.

If someone were to even attempt to unencrypt your data, the entire document would terminate.  We pride ourselves in security and invest heavily (certainly more so than any other WordPress plugin) to protect our users and their clients.

*Unique Signer Invitations*

Signed PDF documents are only available for download when 1) the document sender is logged in and 2) when the signer uses their unique signer invitation URL.  This prevents any unauthorized person from viewing or downloading a copy of your contract.

*Responsive Design*

Let your clients sign on the go.  Our customizable Wordpress contract platform operates on every leading desktop and mobile browser for Android & iOS devices including Chrome, FireFox, Opera, and Safari.

*Instant Trigger Contracts*

We make it easy to move your clients down the funnel.  In addition to sending contracts via email, now you can redirect a signer immediately to your contract after submitting their data in a WP Form.  This helps prevent any distraction to make sure your contract gets taken care of right away.

*Dynamic Form Fields*

Automatically include user information submitted through your WP form into your contract, even when using more complex forms.

*Signing Reminder Emails*

If your client has not yet signed, send automatic reminder emails to make sure they do.  Choose the trigger date, frequency, and expiration dates to make sure your contracts get signed.

*Zero Monthly Fees Per User + Unlimited Users*

Let everyone on your team use the plugin, and create as many contracts as you want.  No limits or hidden fees, ever.

**Secure your contracts and rest easy.  [click here for a demo](http://www.secure.approveme.com/demo/?utm_source=wprepo&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=wpforms)**

###How it Works:###


*The plugin for WP Forms is very simple to setup. With an active ApproveMe business license, you can instantly produce a legally binding (court accepted) contract utilizing completed WP Forms data and require your WP Forms submitter to add their signature on your WP E Signature generated contract.*

This plugin is amazing for Freelancers, Web Designers, Photographers and Small Business owners who want to simplify their contract generation process.


###Get started by following these simple WP Forms Signature Plugin setup steps###


**Step 1:**
ApproveMe's WP E Signature requires a few more plugins/add-ons to help you release the full power and automate WP Forms as well as Digital Signatures that are legally binding. The following plugins are required:


1. [WP Forms Lite](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wpforms-lite/)
2. [WP E Signature](http://aprv.me/2lIyMBx) (ultimate, business or pro license)
3. [E-Signature Business Pack](http://aprv.me/2ko4HGU) (comes with your license above)
4. [Signature Add-On by ApproveMe](this plugin)


**Step 2:**
*Input your ApproveMe license*
After you’ve purchased a business license from ApproveMe, you must input your new license key to launch upgrades and access technical support.


Log into your account to download your license key [ApproveMe account](http://aprv.me/2leZLUs) here (your password is included in the receipt emailed to you)


**Step 3:**
*Set up a blank WordPress page*
Once the WP eSignature plugins and add-ons have been installed and your configurations are saved, you must set up a blank WordPress webpage for every Stand Alone Document (or contract) you will be producing/sending to your form submitters.

Discover more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting this [helpful article](http://aprv.me/2kHY91P)


**Step 4:**
*Set up a Stand Alone Document*
Using your new blank WordPress page, you will then need to produce a Stand Alone Document and then connect the WordPress page to our Stand Alone Document.

Find out more about Stand Alone Documents by visiting [documentation page](http://aprv.me/2lNT887) for this add-on.


**Step 5:**
*(optional) Input WPForms User Details into a Contract*


This step will be different depending on the desired outcome you want. Approve Me's Digital Signature is triggered once a WP Form is submitted. This add-on gives you the power to incorporate WP Form user info (which was inputted from the customer once the form was submitted) into a brand new contract form which will either be emailed to the customer or shown to the customer after they submit the form.


**How to use WP Forms to add form fields details into a contract**


Go to the Signer Input Fields/Custom Fields symbol and choose "WP Form Data".


Choose the WP Form that you’ve already made (and want to link with your contract form) using the drop down option list.

Pick the field info you want to include in your new contract.

A shortcode is created using this data. Don’t worry — your customer will only see the real field value when signing your contract.

This is an example of the auto-generated shortcode which will get placed in the document you are producing when you select your desired field value from your WP Form.


[esig wpformid="3" field_id="1" ]


You can easily transfer the shortcode to any place in your contract form.  It will show the customer’s provided info anywhere the shortcode is found.


**Step 6:**
*Select your document preferences and save settings*

When you have inserted all of your required contract text and have linked your preferred WP Forms field data to your Stand Alone Document, you’re ready to choose your document settings.

Note: Before you can post your contract form, you also have to link your Stand Alone Document with the blank WordPress webpage you made previously for your contract. Do this by looking for and choosing the webpage from the "Display on this page" drop down option list found under the "Document Options" area. We decided NOT to include this page in your nav menu since it will be connected to a WP Form and will not work properly unless it has the field values of that submitted WP Form.


**Step 7:**
*Almost there… (halfway done)*
Once you've published your Stand Alone Document, you’re halfway done. In the next step you have to pick your "trigger" and "action" selections for this document in WP Forms.


Select LET'S GO NOW! to establish those final WP Forms preferences.


**Step 8:**
*Finalize creating the WP Form workflow/trigger*

We’re coming to the end!  Now all you need to do is select your contract and your preferred actions once the workflow is activated.

Go to the "Forms" tab located in the WordPress control panel.

Select the form you attached to the Stand Alone Document.

Choose the "E-Signature" choice within the form options and specify the remaining options.

Now You're done!

== Screenshots ==
1. **Add New Document:** Once you’ve installed the WP E-Signature, you will need to draft up a new “Stand Alone Document”


2. **WP Forms Data** If you click the Signer Input Fields icon you will see the option “WP Forms Data.” Click this to connect a WP Form to this contract.


3. **Select Your WP Forms:** If you already have your WP Form created you can easily insert dynamic field data (from the WP Form that is being submitted/triggering this contract) by selecting the WP Form.

4. **Choose Your WP Forms Fields:** After selecting your WP Form you will see the available field options from this particular WP Form. You can easily insert data from your WP Form anywhere in this new contract.


5. **Document Signing Options (optional):** The powerful WP eSignature tool by ApproveMe features plenty of customizable options including: Signing reminder Emails, Attach PDF to emails, Dropbox Sync, Auto Register WordPress Users, and TONS more. To read all about the available add-on features (which come with the business license) please see: [https://www.approveme.com/esign-integrations](http://aprv.me/2lNRp2C)

6. **Connect Your Document to a Page:**Once you’re satisfied with your contract, you will need to select a BLANK WordPress page to attach this document to. 

Important: Do NOT include this page in your Nav menu since all of the magic actually happens after the WP Form is submitted (there’s no need to link to this page because the user will either be emailed a custom link or they will be automatically redirected once the WP Form is submitted).


7. **Click “LET’S GO NOW”:**After you have published your contract, you just need to connect your Stand Alone Document to your WP Form. This is pretty straight forward. Just click the button “LET’S GO NOW!” to be redirected to the actions/trigger tab for your specific WP Form.


8. **Define Your Signing Logic:** This is the page (inside of WP Forms) that needs to be customized. Please choose the Signer’s Full Name and the Signer’s Email address along with any other additional eSignature settings you’d like to include with your contract.


9. **User Submits a WP Forms** Once a user submits the WP Form that you connected to your WP eSignature contract, they will either be immediately redirected to the contract or emailed an unique invitation to sign their contract.  All submitted details from WP Forms will be included.


10. **Review & eSign:** Your users will review the contract before finalizing the contract with their signature.


11. **Select a Digital Signature:**Signers can choose a typed or digital signature


12. **Agree & eSign:** With their e-signature, the customers agree to the terms of the document.

13. **View Signed Document Email:**Signers will be sent an email that includes the link to the document (and a PDF version of the contract if you opted for this method).


14. **Save as PDF:**Customers can either view, print or download their signed document from the website. To do this, they need to click “View Signed Document” in the email that was sent to them upon signing. (With the “Attach as PDF” add-on installed, you can also automatically include the signed contract as a PDF attachment in this email.)


15. **WordPress Audit Trail eSignature Certificate:**  Proving signer intent is a very important component to signing electronic documents. Every contract that is signed using WP E-Signature includes a detailed Signature Certificate. You can [read all about the security of this report here](http://aprv.me/2kveV3E).
